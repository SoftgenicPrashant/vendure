# Storyblok

The world's first headless CMS that works for both developers & business users.

Vue Storefront & Vendure provides an integration with [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/) based on `@vue-storefront/storyblok` package and [documentation](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/storyblok/).

It is already implemented in the [template-vendure](https://github.com/vuestorefront/template-vendure) repository in a [feat/storyblok-integration](https://github.com/vuestorefront/template-vendure/tree/feat/storyblok-integration) branch.

:::warning
This integration is only between Vue Storefront and Storyblok. In order to fetch data from Vendure and use it in Storyblok (like fetch products and display them in Storyblok as content) you would need a plugin in Storyblok that is not yet developed.
